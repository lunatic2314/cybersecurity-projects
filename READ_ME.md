# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects focused on real-world defensive security, cloud infrastructure security, and system hardening. Each project emphasizes practical implementation, documentation, and security principles aligned with industry best practices.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate applied cybersecurity skills rather than theoretical knowledge or guided labs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud security fundamentals (AWS)
- Network segmentation and traffic control
- Secure system deployment and access management
- Linux system administration and hardening
- Security documentation and architecture design
- Risk-aware infrastructure configuration

## Projects

### 1. AWS EC2 Deployment in a Custom VPC
**Focus:** Cloud Infrastructure Security  
Designed and deployed an Amazon EC2 instance within a custom AWS VPC. Configured public subnet routing through an Internet Gateway, implemented route tables, and established secure SSH access using key-based authentication.

**Key Concepts:**
- VPC design and CIDR planning
- Public subnet routing
- Internet Gateway configuration
- Secure remote access (SSH)
- Linux system updates and administration

### 2. Cloud Network Segmentation
**Focus:** Network Security  
Implemented subnet-based segmentation within a cloud environment to control traffic flow and reduce exposure. Emphasized separation of resources and routing control.

**Key Concepts:**
- Subnets and Availability Zones
- Route tables
- Attack surface reduction
- Network isolation principles

### 3. Linux System Hardening (Cloud-Based)
**Focus:** Host Security  
Performed baseline hardening on a cloud-hosted Linux system, including patch management and secure administrative access.

**Key Concepts:**
- Patch management
- Privilege control
- Secure remote administration
- System maintenance best practices
