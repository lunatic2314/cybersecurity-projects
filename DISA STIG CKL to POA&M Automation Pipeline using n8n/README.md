# DISA STIG CKL to POA&M Automation Engine

Automated DISA STIG checklist processing workflow built in **n8n** that converts **CKL XML findings into POA&M-ready CSV outputs** for remediation tracking, RMF evidence management, and compliance operations.

This workflow ingests **Windows 11 SCC / CKL checklist files**, parses XML findings, normalizes vulnerability metadata, applies **risk and priority logic**, and exports a structured **POA&M spreadsheet** ready for engineering teams, ISSOs, and audit stakeholders.

---

## 🚀 Business Problem
Manual CKL-to-POA&M creation is repetitive, slow, and error-prone.

Security and compliance teams often spend hours manually:
- reviewing STIG findings
- extracting failed controls
- assigning ownership
- defining milestones
- creating remediation timelines
- formatting spreadsheets for closure tracking

This workflow automates that process end-to-end.
