## 1️⃣ Workflow Orchestration – n8n End-to-End Pipeline
### n8n Workflow Overview

![n8n Workflow Overview](Screenshot%202026-04-13%20202235.png)

**Objective:** Automate the transformation of STIG CKL/XML findings into structured POA&M artifacts.

### What Happened:
- Imported CKL/XML checklist data from disk
- Parsed XML into structured JSON objects
- Applied JavaScript transformation logic for normalization
- Mapped findings into POA&M schema-ready rows
- Converted JSON output into downloadable CSV evidence

### Why It Matters:
This validates workflow orchestration and automation of manual RMF evidence handling tasks.

### Security / Governance Value:
- Continuous monitoring support
- RMF evidence standardization
- Reduced manual spreadsheet processing
- Faster audit preparation cycles

## 2️⃣ Data Transformation – XML to JSON Parsing
### XML Parsing Output

**Objective:** Normalize raw DISA STIG CKL evidence into machine-readable data.

### What Happened:
- Extracted vulnerability IDs
- Parsed control IDs, rule IDs, and benchmark references
- Captured raw checklist failure descriptions
- Preserved STIG metadata for downstream mapping

### Why It Matters:
Transforms semi-structured compliance data into automation-ready records.

## 3️⃣ POA&M Logic Processing – Risk Prioritization & Ownership
### POA&M Logic Node

**Objective:** Apply business logic required for POA&M management.

### What Happened:
- Assigned risk levels based on CAT severity
- Generated POA&M priority values (P1/P2/P3)
- Added ownership team mappings
- Calculated milestone dates
- Inserted remediation resource requirements

### Governance Mapping:
- NIST RMF POA&M tracking
- FedRAMP continuous monitoring workflows
- DISA STIG remediation lifecycle

## 4️⃣ Structured Output – CSV Export Validation
### POA&M CSV Output

![POA&M CSV Output](Screenshot%202026-04-13%20200557.png)

**Objective:** Validate successful generation of structured remediation artifacts.

### What Happened:
- Exported 163 structured findings
- Confirmed field mapping integrity
- Preserved remediation comments
- Included closure validation evidence fields
- Retained benchmark traceability references

### Why It Matters:
This confirms artifact portability for:
- ISSO review
- SCC / CKL validation
- leadership reporting
- audit evidence packages

---

## 5️⃣ Final Artifact Review – Sanitized Spreadsheet Evidence
### Sanitized Spreadsheet Output

![Sanitized Spreadsheet Output](Screenshot%202026-04-13%20200557.png)

**Objective:** Demonstrate final audit-ready POA&M evidence format.

### What Happened:
- Verified remediation comments align with STIG requirement
- Confirmed scheduled completion dates
- Preserved control traceability
- Included SCC/CKL closure validation notes
- Maintained benchmark title references

### Outcome:
- CKL imported
- Findings normalized
- Risk prioritized
- CSV exported
- Spreadsheet ready for POA&M review
- Closure evidence documented

---

## 🧠 Final Result
This lab demonstrates:
- STIG CKL/XML evidence ingestion
- XML → JSON normalization
- JavaScript-based compliance logic
- Automated POA&M row generation
- Risk prioritization workflows
- RMF artifact standardization
- CSV evidence export
- Closure validation support
- Audit-ready spreadsheet generation

This project validates end-to-end compliance automation capability in an enterprise-style RMF / continuous monitoring workflow.
