# 🦸 Superhero Name Generator

A Python-based, user-driven superhero name generator that dynamically recombines user input to create randomized superhero identities.  
This project does not rely on predefined word banks and instead generates names entirely from user-supplied input.

## Features
- Open-ended user input
- Randomized name generation
- Replayable without restarting the program
- No external libraries required

## How It Works
Users enter any words or phrases they choose (traits, places, powers, symbols).  
The program then randomly recombines those inputs to generate unique superhero names.
