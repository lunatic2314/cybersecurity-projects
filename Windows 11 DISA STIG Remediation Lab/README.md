# Windows 11 DISA STIG Remediation Lab | CAT I SEHOP Compliance Fix

## 📌 Overview
This project documents the remediation of a **CAT I DISA Windows 11 STIG finding** on a personal Windows 11 workstation using a **risk-based hardening approach**.

The control was identified through **SCAP Compliance Checker**, analyzed in **STIG Viewer**, remediated through a **registry-based configuration change**, and validated through a **follow-up SCAP re-scan**.

This lab demonstrates a real-world compliance workflow:

> **Identify → Analyze → Remediate → Validate → Document**

The selected control was **Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)**, a Windows exploit mitigation designed to reduce the likelihood of successful memory corruption and buffer overflow attacks.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Safely remediate a **single CAT I Windows 11 STIG finding** while preserving workstation usability.

### Control Information
- **Vulnerability ID:** V-253284
- **STIG ID:** WN11-00-000150
- **Rule Title:** Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) must be enabled
- **Severity:** CAT I
- **CCI:** CCI-002824

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SCAP Compliance Checker 5.14
- STIG Viewer 3.7
- Windows Registry Editor
- Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
- DISA Windows 11 STIG Benchmark
- Compliance evidence screenshots

---

## 🧪 Lab Workflow
This project follows a complete STIG remediation lifecycle:

1. Run baseline SCAP compliance assessment
2. Identify CAT I failed controls
3. Analyze detailed failed SEHOP finding
4. Validate DISA fix guidance in STIG Viewer
5. Perform registry-based remediation
6. Re-run SCAP benchmark
7. Validate PASS result
8. Document compliance evidence

# 📸 Evidence Walkthrough

---

## 1️⃣ Initial SCAP Baseline Score
The initial Windows 11 SCAP assessment returned a **36.41% compliance score**, confirming multiple CAT I and CAT II findings.

This establishes the **baseline security posture** before remediation.

### Key Takeaway
This screenshot demonstrates:
- baseline compliance score
- initial assessment evidence
- measurable improvement target

---

## 2️⃣ CAT I Finding Identification
The results page highlighted multiple **CAT I high-severity controls**, including the target finding:

> **V-253284 - Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) must be enabled**

### Key Takeaway
This screenshot proves:
- CAT I triage process
- severity prioritization
- targeted remediation selection

---

## 3️⃣ Detailed Failed SEHOP Finding
The detailed SCAP report confirmed the failure condition:

- Registry value missing
- Automated rule failed
- required DWORD value not found

Required registry setting:

```text
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel
DisableExceptionChainValidation = 0
```

### Root Cause
The registry value **`DisableExceptionChainValidation`** did not exist, causing the automated validation check to fail.

---

## 4️⃣ Registry-Based Remediation
The missing DWORD value was manually created in **Registry Editor**.

### Remediation Steps
1. Open `regedit`
2. Navigate to:

```text
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel
```

3. Create **DWORD (32-bit)**:
```text
DisableExceptionChainValidation
```

4. Set value to:
```text
0
```

5. Reboot the workstation
6. Re-run SCAP benchmark

### Key Takeaway
This demonstrates:
- safe registry-based hardening
- exploit mitigation enforcement
- production-safe remediation workflow

---

## 5️⃣ Post-Remediation Improved Score
After applying the registry fix and re-running the benchmark, the score increased from:

- **36.41% → 36.82%**

This proves measurable compliance improvement.

![Post Remediation Score](screenshots/05-post-remediation-score.png)

### Improvement Achieved
- **+0.41% compliance increase**
- 1 CAT I control successfully remediated
- improved endpoint exploit mitigation posture

---

## 6️⃣ Final PASS Validation
The final SCAP detailed report confirms the control changed from:

- **Before:** FAIL
- **After:** PASS

The registry object test now validates successfully.

![Final PASS Validation](screenshots/06-sehop-pass-validation.png)

### Validation Outcome
This is the strongest evidence in the project because it confirms:
- successful remediation
- validated registry state
- automated SCAP pass
- closed CAT I finding

---

# 🔍 Technical Explanation
SEHOP protects Windows systems against attacks that abuse **Structured Exception Handling overwrite chains**, commonly associated with memory corruption exploitation.

The required STIG setting ensures the following registry value exists:

```text
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel
DisableExceptionChainValidation = 0
```

A missing key causes the system to fail automated DISA validation.

---

# 📈 Results Summary
## Before
- Compliance score: **36.41%**
- CAT I finding: **FAIL**

## After
- Compliance score: **36.82%**
- CAT I finding: **PASS**

## Security Improvement
- improved exploit mitigation
- reduced memory corruption attack reliability
- strengthened Windows endpoint hardening
- validated DISA STIG compliance delta
